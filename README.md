# Repository `liquid_templates`

This repository contains custom Shopify `.liquid` template files I've created.

## File Contents

Each `.liquid` file contains a combination of HTML, CSS, and Liquid syntax. The Liquid syntax is used to insert dynamic content into the templates.

For example, in `section-product-quiz.liquid`, there is a schema defined using Liquid syntax. This schema includes settings for various elements of the product quiz, such as the headline, description, link text, and background images. These settings can be customized to change the appearance and content of the product quiz.
